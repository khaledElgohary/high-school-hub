<h1 id="iteration-3-worksheet">Iteration 3 Worksheet</h1>
<h2 id="what-technical-debt-has-been-cleaned-up">What technical debt has
been cleaned up</h2>
<p>Show links to a commit where you paid off technical debt. Write 2-5
sentences that explain what debt was paid, and what its classification
is.</p>
<h2 id="what-technical-debt-did-you-leave">What technical debt did you
leave?</h2>
<p>What one item would you like to fix, and can’t? Anything you write
will not be marked negatively. Classify this debt.</p>
<h2 id="discuss-a-feature-or-user-story-that-was-cutre-prioritized">Discuss
a Feature or User Story that was cut/re-prioritized</h2>
<p>When did you change the priority of a Feature or User Story? Why was
it re-prioritized? Provide a link to the Feature or User Story. This can
be from any iteration.</p>
<h2 id="acceptance-testend-to-end">Acceptance test/end-to-end</h2>
<p>Write a discussion about an end-to-end test that you wrote. What did
you test, how did you set up the test so it was not flaky? Provide a
link to that test.</p>
<h2 id="acceptance-test-untestable">Acceptance test, untestable</h2>
<p>What challenges did you face when creating acceptance tests? What was
difficult or impossible to test?</p>
<h2 id="n1-acceptance-test">n+1 Acceptance test</h2>
<p>From class, every team must post an acceptance test script to the
forum. Look at team n+1’s acceptance test, and record yourself
performing it (the android emulator can do screen recordings!). Post
that recording to the forum, link to it here.</p>
<h2 id="velocityteamwork">Velocity/teamwork</h2>
<p>Did your estimates get better or worse through the course? Show some
evidence of the estimates/actuals from tasks.</p>
