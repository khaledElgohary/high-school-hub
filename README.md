## <div align="center"><p style="color: orange; font-size:larger;"><ins>**Purpose of Highschool Hub**</ins></p></div>
<p style="font-size:large;color:white">Highschool Hub is a social platform where users can find other users who went to or worked at the high school they attended. After registering for an account, users will gain access to their own profile page where they can add their personal informationâ€”this can include their name, age, bio, marital status, social media links, and photos. Additionally, users will be able to add high schools they have attended to their profile, which will be an important feature that further allows users to find other users from their high school. When a user finds another user they would like to connect with, the app will offer the option of notifying this user; if a user agrees to be discoverable to another user, the other user will be able to view their socials.</p><br>

## <div align="center"><p style="color: orange; font-size:larger;"><ins>**How to Run the App**</ins></p></div>
<p style="font-size:large;color:white;">&emsp;&emsp;To run highschool you will need an Android device with API 21 or later. To build the application, first download the latest version of Android Studio if you have not already and then simply download all the files from the main branch. Once you download the main branch you can then open the directory that is created. The project is configured as an Android application so opening Android Studio on the directory will automatically sync 
the build files to your local computer. After Android Studio is done syncing, you will then be able to build the app and run it on the emulator in Android Studio 
or even on an actual Android device with API 21 or later. Additionally, the project also contains three different types of tests. Unit tests and Integration 
tests which can be run by running AllTests and AllIntegrationTests classes in Android Studio. These classes can be found in app -> src -> test -> java -> 
comp3350 -> highschoolhub -> tests. There are also system tests for the app which can be found in app -> src -> androidTest -> java -> comp3350 -> highschoolhub for testing all layers of the app. </p><br>
