          <h2 class="text-primary">Description</h2>
          <p class="justify">Highschool Hub is a social platform where users can find other users who
            went to or worked at the high school they attended. After registering
            for an account, users will gain access to their own profile page where
            they can add their personal information—this can include their name,
            age, bio, marital status, social media links, and photos. Additionally,
            users will be able to add high schools they have attended to their
            profile, which will be an important feature that further allows users
            to find other users from their high school. When a user finds another
            user they would like to connect with, the app will offer the option of
            notifying this user; if a user agrees to be discoverable to another
            user, the other user will be able to view their socials.</p>
          <p class="indent justify">Unlike other social media platforms (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.),
            Highschool Hub will be limited to high schools, which makes it more
            focused and, hence, easier to use. Users will benefit from this
            limitation since they would not be overwhelmed by all the additional
            features that come with a contemporary social media platform.</p>

          <h2 class="text-primary">Users</h2>
          <p class="justify">The users of this app are high school students (past and current) and
            high school staff (past and current) who would like to connect with
            other students and staff from their high school. Notably, high school
            graduates who have lost touch with friends from high school would
            greatly benefit from using this app. However, anyone who has attended
            high school can find value in easily connecting with other students and
            staff from their high school.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8 py-4">
          <h2 class="text-primary">Value</h2>
          <p class="justify">The goal of this app is not to provide a prototypical social media
            platform. Specifically, a chat feature will not be included since users
            have the capability to add their socials on their respective profile
            pages. Said social links provide chat features far superior than the
            chat feature that can be included in the app.</p>
          <p class="indent justify">The goal of Highschool Hub is for users to notify each other of their
            existence and connect via their provided socials. The value of this app
            lies within the idea that it’s designed for a specific purpose—finding
            contacts from high school. Social media platforms contain an enormous
            number of users, with a lot of duplicate names, which makes it
            challenging to find your high school friends and staff. With that being
            said, the app is designed to allow the users access to only the
            database of users within their high school specified grade/year, which
            will make it much simpler when it comes to searching for users.</p>
          <p class="indent justify">The app, although simplistic, allows users to expand their social
            network in a targeted manner. In fact, the simplicity of the app drives
            its usefulness. Users can now expand their academic circle by
            connecting to students and teachers. This is a major improvement over
            traditional social media platforms because it reduces clutter and makes
            connecting with others easier.</p>

          <p class="justify">The app will be considered successful if we are able to get around 250
            new users in one month or less, or if at least 75% of new users
            successfully find and connect with a user from their high school within
            one month of using the app.</p>
