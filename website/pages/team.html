          <p class="justify">One of the main things I learned while developing this project is the Software
            Development Life Cycle. That, in tandem with AGILE and applying SOLID principles, gave me a much
            better understanding of what goes into development. Furthermore, I learned Version Control and
            branching strategies which taught me how to work on a large project being developed by many people.
            I also learned how to work with generated code, XML files and layout managers when designing the UI
            for the app. Another thing this project taught me is layered architecture which vastly improved my
            ability to functionally decompose large domain problems into small, cohesive and low coupling artifacts.
            This project has improved my skills as a developer in several ways.</p>

          <p class="justify">Some of the skills that I developed while creating the app is being able to
            apply SOLID design principles while creating the different classes. This is a very important skill
            as SOLID design principles enable you to write clean code that is easy to maintain as well as extendable.
            I have also developed skills in using Test Driven Development (TDD). Before creating this application, I
            never used TDD before, but I found that while I used it in this project, I was writing code that is simpler,
            easier to understand, as well as easy to maintain.</p>

          <p class="justify">During the development process, I learned how to work closely with
            other developers to create an application from scratch. I gained experience in working
            as a team to design, plan, and implement an entirely new project from the ground up,
            which will be important experience for the future. Furthermore, this was my first time
            developing a mobile application, and I learned a considerable amount using what I learned
            in COMP 3350 classes to develop a better app.</p>

            and editing User Interfaces, and also how apps are built from scratch, all the way till they are
            a well developed and tested product. Also, being able to work closely with other developers enabled
            me to gain a general idea of how working in teams in large corporations can look like.</p>
