      <h2 class="text-primary">What went right in the development process?</h2>
      <p class="justify">Notably, communication and teamwork were consistently strong throughout
        the development process. Before starting development for each iteration, we held at least
        one meeting to plan our tasks, assign work to team members, and resolve any doubts or
        problems from the previous iteration. This allowed us to start off each iteration on the
        right foot, ensuring everyone was on the same page and knew what they needed to complete
        for the iteration. Additionally, all team members regularly chatted with other team members
        to address issues, ask and answer questions, and discuss any matters they had on their mind.
        The frequent communication created an environment where we could work cohesively as a team in
        order to develop a better application.</p>
      <p class="indent justify">Along with good communication, everyone played a role in developing a functional
        app. All team members were dedicated to the project and made important contributions to various
        aspects such as planning, development, and testing. Because of this, we were able to have a fully
        functional and stable app by the deadline for iteration 1 and 2, which was also a result of being
        able to work well together.</p>

      <div class="row featurette-padding py-4">
        <h2 class="text-primary">What went wrong in the development process?</h2>
        <p class="justify">While we completed all tasks early in iteration 1, we were pressed for time near
          the end of iteration 2, leaving us little time to test the application. Some of the work for the
          iteration was completed fairly late, and this impacted our ability to thoroughly verify that the
          new functionalities were working correctly. We have planned to start and complete our development
          work earlier for iteration 3, which should increase the time we have for polishing and improving
          the app as well as lessen the pressure of getting everything complete right before the deadline.</p>
        <p class="indent justify">We also ran into some problems with merge conflicts and resolving them
          efficiently. Pulling changes from <code>main</code> into local branches was infrequent at times,
          which caused issues with attempting to merge these local branches into main later on. For iteration
          3, we aimed to be more proactive in keeping our local branches up to date, making the process of
          merging back into <code>main</code> far smoother and less prone to mistakes when resolving potential
          conflicts.</p>

        <h2 class="text-primary">How did the project change from our initial vision or stories? Did it work out as predicted?</h2>
        <p class="justify">We made a couple of reductions to the planned features for our app. For example,
          we initially wanted to implement admin users in our application. These admin users would be able
          to manage the high schools available for regular users of the application and create additional
          admin users to perform this task. However, we realized this may be excessive for the current
          scope of our app—we are currently only including high schools in Winnipeg, which greatly
          simplifies and decreases the high schools we can have available. Adding admin users at this time
          may be an unnecessary addition, though it is something we could theoretically consider implementing
          in the future.</p>
        <p class="indent justify">Some of our features also grew bigger or more complicated than expected, and
          we sometimes moved these features into later iterations so we could have the time we needed to
          complete them. We also reduced the features that would make it into the app by the end of iteration 3
          to account for this—some lower priority features have been cut from our initial plan.</p>
        <p class="indent justify">Aside from the points above, the project does not differ much from our initial
          vision and stories; we have implemented the general functionality described in our vision statement.</p>
